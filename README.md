# My Nvim

- This is my current nvim setup on Fedora 38. Honestly, this is pretty much just [_nvChad_](https://nvchad.com/) with somewhat working linting and autoformating for python and javascript. Most of what I did was also following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVCBHHFXWNE) video, with some changes here and there.
