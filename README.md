# My Nvim

- This is my current [neovim](https://github.com/neovim) setup on Fedora 38. Honestly, this is pretty much just [_nvChad_](https://nvchad.com/) configured to how I best like it. Most of the initial setup I did was also following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVCBHHFXWNE) video.

To install run the following commands in your equivalent `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. You should already have neovim and git installed.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/alllga/myNvim
nvim
```
